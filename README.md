# MacOSVibrant

![Showcase img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tnings/MacosVibrant/main/Images/Pic.png)
MacOSVibrant is a one file firefox modification that **only works on MacOS**. It is themed after apple apps, such as the music app. <br />

You can use any firefox theme you want with it, but it works best with my theme, AppleStyledTheme 2. It is a theme that uses the same colors as the apple dark theme on MacOS. <br />

Currently, this theme is only made to work on dark theme, if there is demand I can update it for light theme. <br />

This theme is based off of [ProtoVibrant](https://github.com/bpwned/protovibrant), and borrows code from [Simply Silver/Peach](https://github.com/CristianDragos/FirefoxThemes/tree/master/Simplify%20Silver%20Peach) for the tabs. <br />

If you find any bugs, or have a tweak you think could make MacOSVibrant better, please make an issue and we can discuss it! <br />

I hope you enjoy this skin!
